# Journal 1 - 28 September 2020

Today, I am reflecting on what I have learned about refactoring and good html design. I ran into a funny issue today that may have been due to some weird html structure on my part, so I want to keep that clean as we move forward. In today's lab, I wanted to keep the javascript fairly reasonable and modular, so I made an effort to write my functions so that I could come back later and easily add, say, more questions or more messages that display the user's performance.

On a learning note, I want to focus on asking good questions. Today, there were a couple of instances where I rambled a bit when asking a question, because I didn't know exactly what I wanted. At the same time, not knowing how to ask a certain question has given me lots of 'classroom anxiety' in the past, so I want to focus on getting my question out and getting it out clearly.

I am still having a hard time remembering how to do everything at the beginning of lab time after we finish lecture. Even though Dani says we shouldn't code along, my feeling is that doing this would solidify a lot of the information in my brain. I suspect they tell us this so that we can focus on discussion AND so that we must practice googling and finding information later. Naturally, I'll stick to what Dani says, just a thought. 

Is this what a journal is supposed to be???
