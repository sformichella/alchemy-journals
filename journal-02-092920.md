# Journal 2 - 29 September 2020

Lecture was about the same today. I got myself way more confused today with all of the details of the lab. In the future, I am going to be more careful with my planning. I made a plan today, but it really wasn't that different from the outline in my head, so it didn't help me very much. Tomorrow, I'm going to look at Dani's plan and try to write my own based on theirs. 

I can see why we are focusing on maintainability so much. I just want to get more labs under my belt to get better at planning and writing in a sensible way.
